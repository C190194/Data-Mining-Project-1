The Part 2 code implementation includes 7 Python files, "discretization.py", "readfile", "preprocessing.py", "ruleitem.py", "rulegenerator", "CBA_CB_M2.py" and  "result.py"

To run the program, you may run the "result.py". And change the path directory at the end part of the code to see different results for different datasets. Then it will print all the results for the specific chosen datasets in the console.
